be careful:
1. This document only represents the product knowledge and parameters at the time of editing, and any changes in the future will not be notified separately.
2. If external power supply is required, simply connect the external power supply+stage to the 5V position and GND to the negative terminal. (Supports 3.3-6V power supply).
3. Remember that when connecting to an external power source, USB cannot be connected, and only one of USB and external power can be selected.
4. Please be careful not to short-circuit the positive and negative electrodes during welding, which may burn out the battery and equipment.
